            <h2>My Adventure in Kodaikanal</h2>
            <p>
                It's set in an area of granite cliffs, forested valleys, lakes, waterfalls and grassy
                hills. At 2,000 meters above sea level, the town centers around man-made, star-shaped Kodaikanal Lake,
                bordered by evergreen forest. Rowing boats can be hired, and hikers and cyclists follow the 5k Lake Road
                path around the shore.

                <li>Kodaikanal is a “Princess of Hills”, Kodaikanal is one of the most sought-after hill station
                    destinations in Tamil Nadu and the whole of India</li>
                <li> Located at about 7000 ft above the sea-level, Kodaikanal was established as a destination by
                    British bureaucrats and Christian missionaries in the year of 1845</li>
                <li>However the modern era of Kodaikanal began only after the British came in</li>
                <li>The verdant hills, the cascading waterfalls, picturesque lakes, pristine countrysides - the reason
                    why Kodaikanal has been popular among tourists are many. </li>
                <li>Boating, cycling, horse riding and trekking are some of the most common among them. </li>
                <li>One of the other spectacles of this region is the Kurinji flower that blooms only once in 12 years,
                    making itself a unique spectacle to watch.</li>
            </ul>
