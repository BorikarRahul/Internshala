        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I wear many hats: coder, wanderer, foodie, and wildlife enthusiast. My journey has taken me to
            breathtaking places, introduced me to fascinating cultures, and allowed me to capture moments
            through my
            lens. 📸</p>

            <h3>Travel Enthusiast 🌎 </h3>
            From the bustling streets of Tokyo to the serene beaches of Bali, I’ve explored diverse landscapes,
            tasted
            local delicacies, and met incredible people. Traveling isn’t just about ticking off destinations;
            it’s about
            immersing yourself in the stories each place has to tell. 🗺️
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Film Buff 🎬</h3>
            Movies are my escape hatch. Whether it’s a gripping thriller, a heartwarming drama, or a
            mind-bending sci-fi
            flick, I find solace in the magic of cinema. 🎥
            <br><br>
            <h3>Photography Addict 📷</h3>
            My camera is my constant companion. The play of light, the candid smiles, the rustling leaves—I
            freeze these
            fleeting moments into pixels. Wildlife photography, in particular, fuels my soul. 🦁
            <br><br>
            <h3>Foodie Extraordinaire 🍔</h3>
            Food is more than sustenance; it’s an adventure. From street-side chaat in Mumbai to sushi in Kyoto,
            I’ve
            savored flavors that tell tales of tradition, love, and innovation. 🍣
            <h3>Why Full Stack Development?</h3>
            Ah, the world of code! Full Stack Development is my playground. Here’s why I’m smitten:
            <ol>
                <li>End-to-End Mastery: As a full stack developer, I dance between front-end and back-end
                    technologies.
                    I craft beautiful user interfaces (UIs) and architect robust server-side logic. 💻</li>
                <li>Versatility: I’m not confined to a single layer. I can build a responsive website, optimize
                    database
                    queries, and even dabble in cloud deployment—all in a day’s work. 🚀</li>
                <li>Problem-Solving Galore: Bugs? Challenges? Bring 'em on! Debugging is my meditation, and
                    solving
                    puzzles keeps my neurons firing. 🔍</li>
                <li>Continuous Learning: Technology evolves faster than a hummingbird’s wings. Full stack
                    development
                    ensures I’m always learning, adapting, and growing. 🌱</li>
            </ol>
